 A project that bridges the gap between managers and residents

The Estate GenieÂ® is an Estate Management Mobile Application Solution specifically designed to bridge the gap between residential Management, Individual residents and service providers within and around any given residential community. Our Simplified digital solution creates a utility platform for ; Individuals, Households, Businesses and service providers who reside/operate in a residential estate to connect, network and interact.
The concept of the app was borne from the desire to bridge the gap between Service Consumers and service providers thus creating a seamless and harmonized flow of transactions and dialogue in our immediate residential communities.
